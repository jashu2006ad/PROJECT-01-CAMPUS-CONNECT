# 🌟 Core Idea

College students often need different services throughout their campus life:

* Finding someone who can teach a skill
* Selling unused textbooks
* Buying second-hand college items
* Finding lost belongings
* Communicating with other students
* Identifying trustworthy users

Instead of using multiple disconnected platforms, **CampusConnect combines these services into one campus-focused ecosystem.**
